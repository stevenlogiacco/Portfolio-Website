                    <br>
                    <p>A nine month all-of-technology project to separate a subsidiary company and migrate to a new owner (Hong Kong based). 
                        The project required a new Microsoft Azure infrastructure build, migration, and change management that included:</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establishment of a new Azure landing zone.</li>
                            <li>Full email migration (including archive).</li>
                            <li>New Wide Area Network (WAN) build, including physical switches, routers, and wireless access point, install and configuration.</li>
                            <li>New unified communications through Microsoft Teams, including number porting and call flow design.</li>
                            <li>Refit of meeting rooms with full conference technology.</li>
                            <li>Virtual desktop build and management server for thin clients.</li>
                            <li>Procure laptops and build new profiles.</li>
                            <li>Migrate applications including a third party document versioning and archiving application, requiring seeding and cutover of data.</li>
                            <li>Penetration testing.</li>
                            <li>Onboarding and technical support set up and on site “day one” support.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Key vendors across multiple time zones.</li>
                            <li>Security requirements of the new owner often got in the way of completing configuration work.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Highlights</h3>
                    <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The final week leading up to cutover where we had most of the project team on site, including representatives from Hong Kong.</li>
                            <li>The detailed cutover plan I created allowed the team to stay focused throughout a tough cutover weekend and helped ensure staff were able to log on to the new domains on Monday morning.</li>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The project team was tasked with building a manual sales approval process into a proprietary CRM. A timeframe of 12 months was set and met. The deliverables included:
                    </p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Converting and validating criteria and margin tolerances for a range of different sales contracts, so they could be coded.</li>
                            <li>Designing approval workflows and gates, at which approval notifications would be sent based on DFA.</li>
                            <li>Automate a weekly agenda that could be executed to generate a presentation of sales deals that required a sitting committee to approve.</li>
                            <li>Integrate with the existing order workflow to ensure approved sales contracts could enter the build and order workflow without additional intervention.</li>
                            <li>Large sales training and operational support/change management workstream.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Personnel issues between the project team and one of the lead developers.</li>
                            <li>Initially under-forecasted efforts by SME’s required changes to the MVP to meet the deadline.</li>
                            <li>A previous project that was considered related to this had not gone well and therefore my team unfairly inherited negative sentiment from the sales team. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <br><br>

                    <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Despite the early issues with team collaboration, the project had one of the smoothest change management phases I have ever run. This was due to the incredible attention to detail paid by key members of the project team throughout the design, build, and testing phases.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The initial design wireframes were completed in a rush by a person who left the company before I took on the project. 
                                It therefore required further interactions as the project progressed. Due to having a very small project team, this was a role I had to step into.</li>
                            <li>The executive stakeholder changed expectations of the project late in development and wanted to limit the ability for technicians to manually set certain parameters. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <br><br>

                        <ul>
                            <li>While working on a project for a different client a year later, I interacted with the technician team and was issued an invoice. It was a great feeling to see it 
                                come full circle and understand the effort that went into the details that were presented to me in the end product.</li>
