                    <p>The project team was tasked with building a manual sales approval process into a proprietary CRM. A timeframe of 12 months was set and met. The deliverables included:

                            <li class="indent">Automate a weekly agenda that could be executed to generate a presentation of sales deals that required a sitting committee to approve.</li>
                            <li class="indent">Integrate with the existing order workflow to ensure approved sales contracts could enter the build and order workflow without additional intervention.</li>

                        <li class="indent">The project was both an internal and customer combined project with the customers WiFi network under customer scope and the platform under internal scope. 
                            There were several occasions where these came into conflict, particularly when it came to time and material charging of effort.</li>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Running a critical network management project, developing and deploying a new software-based platform to replace legacy tools and systems. This was an Agile value-based 
                        delivery initiative run using backlog, sprints, roadmaps and other Agile principles.</p><br><p>I ran multiple cross-organisational workshops to understand requirements and 
                        product design, and I reported milestones and financials directly to the CEO.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>When I took on this project, it was 2 years into its lifecycle and not in a good state. I worked on the project for one year to bring the project 
                        back on track before moving on to other projects. Key activities to achieve this included:</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="indent">A complete redo of the forecasted budget, time, and deliverables.</li>
                            <li class="indent">Presented the new forecast to the executive and CEO. The new budget and timeframe was approved at a board level.</li>
                            <li class="indent">Run workshops with the vendor and internal teams to develop a more robust plan and understanding.</li>
                            <li class="indent">Refocus the project ceremonies and ways of working.</li>
                            <li class="indent">Conduct a complete review of the backlog with the product owner.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Highlights</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Delivering the MVP into production. The first production deliverable in the more than two and a half years of the project's life up to that point.</p>
